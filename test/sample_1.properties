# another comment line
# the next line has spaces, but is blank, so should be ignored
      

# the previous line has zero length
foo = bar
this = is a test of space-containing values
fools : rush in

     indentation : doesn't matter

# make sure this line stays down here   XX-test-XX

more = lines

space separated keys = are okay
if there isn't a colon or equals, the first space will be the separator

this-line-has-no-value

ooh! let's : use a colon here

an\=escaped equals = sign is\=okay
an\:escaped colon : is\:okay

mix\: and \=\:\=  = match FTW

lots of space        =             around the separator
some\ escaped spaces\ don't matter
scrunched=line should expand a bit

windows_path = C\:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.11.1-x64\\bin\\R.exe
escaped_python = {'foo' \: 'bar'}
escaped_math = 3 + 5 \= 8

C\:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.11.1-x64\\bin\\R.exe = still_visible
3 + 5 \= 8 = still_visible
